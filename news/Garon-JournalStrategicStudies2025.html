        <h2 class="news-title">Professor Garon has published a new article in The Journal of Strategic Studies</h2>
        <p class="news-excerpt">
Professor Garon has published a new article in The Journal of Strategic Studies entitled “Toward a Global History of Bombing in the Second World War: Taking Japan Seriously.”
        </p>
        <p class="news-excerpt">
The publication revises key arguments from Richard Overy’s Rain of Ruin, a recent work that reassesses the firebombing and atomic bombing of Japan. By drawing on Japanese-language sources, and taking Japan as a major industrialised Axis power, Garon’s article contends that key assumptions about the meaning of strategic bombing require reconsideration and contributes to a deeper understanding of the Japanese experience during the Second World War.</p>
