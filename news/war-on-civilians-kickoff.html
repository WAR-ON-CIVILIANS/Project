          The inaugural conference of the ERC-funded <em>WAR-ON-CIVILIANS</em> project took place at the Institut d'études avancées (IEA) in Paris from 10 to 11 March 2025.
        </p>
        <p>
          This kick-off meeting brought together the Principal Investigator, newly selected postdoctoral researchers, and members of the Advisory Board to launch the project.
        </p>

          Participants included: Sheldon Garon, Anne van Mourik, Boyd van Dijk, Jan Schmidt, John Horne, Jose Luis Ledesma, Masha Cerovic, Mariella Terzoli, and Victor Louzon.
        </p>
        <p>
          The conference featured discussions on the project's work packages, methodological approaches, the creation of the dataset, and planned publications. A key focus was also placed on coordinating archival research programs across different countries.
        </p>
        <p>
          This event marked the beginning of a multi-year collaborative research effort aimed at shedding new light on the systematic targeting of civilians in modern warfare.
