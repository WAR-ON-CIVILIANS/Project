          This kick-off meeting brought together the Principal Investigator, newly selected postdoctoral researchers, and members of the Advisory Board to launch the project.

        <p>
          This event marked the beginning of a multi-year collaborative research effort aimed at shedding new light on the systematic targeting of civilians in modern warfare.
